                    Hi hello! My name is Madekuji Masamune. I also go by the username Madekuji-san, but you can call me MaDe! (pronounced „Éû„Éá!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a huge otaku! For a lot of things!!! I love anime, manga (especially doujinshi), video games, music, cosplay, tech, trains, fanfics, and VTubers!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also do all sorts of work, like:<br />
                    Web development, UI/UX design, systems administration, tech support, fansubbing, voice acting, event organizing, and more!
                </p>
                <p>
                    ‚Ä¶and I'm now also a VTuber myself, I guess. It wasn't always like that though!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've been making YouTube videos and doing live streams as a hobby for a long time, ever since I was younger. I've always shared my voice if it meant sharing the things I like, or if it meant helping people learn something new.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since then up to now, I always want to keep making things I like; not just for myself, but in the service of others!<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2RWxi-JVYI" target="_blank">Whenever people become happy from the things I do, it makes me happy too!</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I‚Äôm first and foremost a fan, and a huge chunk of what I do comes from the inspiration given to me by the things I like. It's from them I source my aspirations and creativity.

                    Where did the name ‚ÄúMadekuji‚Äù come from?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Yeah, yeah, I know. It's not a real Japanese name. If anything, it‚Äôs more like fake or pseudo-Japanese. That's why it‚Äôs spelled in Katakana! It‚Äôs no secret that I was a weeb back when I was young (and I still have some tendencies!), but I do still keep it around because of what my name means to me now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think my name is a byproduct of the journey of understanding a culture different from the one you started with; one that is unique, fascinating, and beautiful. It's like making your first crayon drawing. Sure, it‚Äôs no Mona Lisa, and it's a bit embarrassing looking at it as you grow older, but it's a reminder of where you started when you didn't know any better and a reflection of the passion you've always had and still carry along with you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the name‚Äôs a bit long, you can simply call me MaDe! I got that name from friends who were a bit tired saying the full thing after a while‚Ä¶ üòÖ
